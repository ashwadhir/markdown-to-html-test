# markdown-to-html-test

## Summary
This web application was auto-generated by an LLM based on the following brief:
> Publish a static page that converts input.md from attachments to HTML with marked, renders it inside #markdown-output, and loads highlight.js for code blocks.

**New Feature:** This application now includes a tabbed interface, allowing users to switch between the rendered HTML output and the original Markdown source. The content in both views is kept in sync.
